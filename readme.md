# BookWorm books

## Purpose & Scope
- Initially the idea was to create a simple app using Node.js and Express, but eventually I decided I wanted to build the front-end and I used the MERN stack to practice React and hack with Materialize.css..
- However, having made the app, I now want the app to be a book exchange service, whereby users create their own library, books that they are happy to lend. This library is available for other users to see and then they can request to borrow a book.
- There should be a search facility so that users can search for a particular book and then request to borrow the book
- Google maps api could be useful potentially, but this could create privacy issues, maybe you put your nearest pub and then that becomes the place to exchange or lend etc??

## Additional elements
- Need to make the landing page a splash page, with idea/purpose of the app, then a link to login or register
- Search needs to be fundamental part of the app - so users can search for books that other users have. Having not done a search bar before this will be a challenge. 

## Challenges
- The site will be very text heavy - need to find some way of adding visuals to the site
